BEA Regions are a set of Geographic Areas that are aggregations of the states. The regional classifications, which were developed in the mid-1950s, are based on the homogeneity of the states in terms of economic characteristics, such as the industrial composition of the labor force, and in terms of demographic, social, and cultural characteristics. BEA groups all 50 states and the District of Columbia into eight distinct regions for purposes of data collecting and analyses.  IPEDS/HEGIS assigns U.S. service schools as their own region.

To ensure continuity of the classification framework and to allow comparison across years, the 2010 Classification update retains the same structure of six parallel classifications, initially adopted in 2005. They are as follows: Basic Classification (the traditional Carnegie Classification Framework), Undergraduate and Graduate Instructional Program classifications, Enrollment Profile and Undergraduate Profile classifications, and Size & Setting classification. These classifications provide different lenses through which to view U.S. colleges and universities, offering researchers greater analytic flexibility. 

These classifications are time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on data from 2008 to 2010. and collectively they depict the most current landscape of U.S. colleges and universities.   Institutions might be classified differently using a different timeframe. Individual classifications are not updated with more recent data.

***Note- Carnegie classifications for IPEDS years 2005-2009,  are the 2005 classifications, which were based on time-specific snapshots of institutional attributes and behavior based on data from 2003 to 2005.

The Basic Classification is an update of the traditional classification framework developed by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education in 1970 to support its research program, and later published in 1973 for use by other researchers. Although this classification has undergone many changes over the years, the current release involves some significant changes from previous editions.

A land-grant college or university is an institution that has been designated by its state legislature or Congress to receive the benefits of the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890. The original mission of these institutions, as set forth in the first Morrill Act, was to teach agriculture, military tactics, and the mechanic arts as well as classical studies so that members of the working classes could obtain a liberal, practical education. 

Over the years, land-grant status has implied several types of federal support. The first Morrill Act provided grants in the form of federal lands to each state for the establishment of a public institution to fulfill the act's provisions. At different times money was appropriated through legislation such as the second Morrill Act and the Bankhead-Jones Act, although the funding provisions of these acts are no longer in effect. Today, the Nelson Amendment to the Morrill Act provides a permanent annual appropriation of $50,000 per state and territory. 

A key component of the land-grant system is the agricultural experiment station program created by the Hatch Act of 1887. The Hatch Act authorized direct payment of federal grant funds to each state to establish an agricultural experiment station in connection with the land-grant institution there. The amount of this appropriation varies from year to year and is determined for each state through a formula based on the number of small farmers there. A major portion of the federal funds must be matched by the state. 

To disseminate information gleaned from the experiment stations' research, the Smith-Lever Act of 1914 created a Cooperative Extension Service associated with each U.S. land-grant institution. This act authorized ongoing federal support for extension services, using a formula similar to the Hatch Act's to determine the amount of the appropriation. This act also requires that the states provide matching funds in order to receive the federal monies.


Passage of the First Morrill Act (1862) reflected a growing demand for agricultural and technical education in the United States. While a number of institutions had begun to expand upon the traditional classical curriculum, higher education was still widely unavailable to many agricultural and industrial workers. The Morrill Act was intended to provide a broad segment of the population with a practical education that had direct relevance to their daily lives.

The Second Morrill Act (1890) sought to extend access to higher education by providing additional endowments for all land-grants, but prohibiting distribution of money to states that made distinctions of race in admissions. However, states that provided a separate land-grant institution for blacks were eligible to receive the funds. The institutions that, as a result of this act, were founded or designated the land-grant for blacks in each of the then-segregated Southern states came to be known as ""the 1890 land-grants.""  Native American tribal colleges are sometimes called the ""1994 land-grants.""

All institutions that participated in Title IV federal financial aid programs were first separated into degree-granting and nondegree-granting groups by control of institution (public, private, not-for-profit and private for-profit). 

Degree-granting institutions were divided into the following groups using the institution category variable: graduate and 4-year primarily baccalaureate and above; 4-year primarily associate's; and 2-year degree-granting. The Carnegie Classification Basic 2018 was then used further classify degree-granting institutions within the 4 groups. The highest degree offered was used for 4-year degree-granting institutions that did not have a carnegie classification. 

The majority of nondegree-granting institutions were grouped by their largest program. The largest program was based on the largest program identified by the cipcode, that the institution reported on the student cost section of the institutional characteristics component. The programs are business (52), communications and communication technologies(09,10), cosmetology(12.04), engineering and engineering technologies(14,15) , manufacturing, construction, repair, and transportation (46,47,48,49) and health (51). All other cipcodes were combined for the other programs category. 

When the above methodolgy yielded small comparison groups (< 4 schools), groups of different controls maybe combined or a 4-year primarily associates maybe combined with a 4-year baccalaureate and above group. 

When the above methodology yielded large groups (greater than 40), groups were further subdivided by size, based on 12-month enrollment, (See cosmetology groups above). 

Special groups were made for the Tribal colleges, U.S. service institutions, and institutions in other jurisdictions, such as Puerto Rico.

In this classification, a single graduate-level degree qualifies an institution for inclusn

The classification is based on the level of graduate degrees awarded (master's degrees, and doctoral degrees categorized as either research/scholarship, professional practice, or other doctorate), the number of fields represented by the degrees awarded, and the mix or concentration of degrees by broad disciplinary domain. The classification has two parts: one for institutions that award at least one research/scholarship doctoral degrees (hereinafter referred to as research doctoral degrees), and one postbaccalaureate degree-granting institutions that either offer only master's degrees or that also offer professional practice or other doctoral degrees (based on the record of degree conferrals, not program offerings). Within each group, institutions are classified respect to the breadth of graduate offerings and the concentration of degrees in certain fields or combinations of fields.

For two categories of institutions offering research doctorates, institutions offering medical education (defined as human or veterinary medical education, including allopathic medicine, osteopathic medicine, dentistry, and veterinary medicine) were distinguished. Institutions in other categories may also offer medical education, but the numbers were not large enough to justify subcategories, and judged it preferable to differentiate with respect to the other graduate fields, rather than with respect to the presence or absence of medical education.

NOTE: Because a single research doctoral degree (as defined in the IPEDS data collection of the National Center for Education Statistics) qualifies an institution for inclusion in the doctoral categories, institutions with large master's or professional programs and modest doctoral-level programs are currently classified according to their doctoral programs.
The categories are listed below. The term ""comprehensive"" is used here to denote comprehensiveness of offerings across a range of fields.

This variable is derived from the enrollment by race/ethnicity section of the fall enrollment survey. The full-time equivalent of the institution's part-time enrollment is estimated and then added to the full-time enrollment of the institution. This formula has been used to produce the full-time equivalent enrollment that is published annually in the Digest of Education Statistics. The full-time equivalent of part-time enrollment is estimated by multiplying the part-time enrollment by factors that vary by control and level of institution and level of student. The following factors were used:

Part-time undergraduate enrollment (line 22) 
Public 4-year .403543
Not-for-profit and for-profit, 4-year .392857

However,if 3 students completed their program but the remaining 3 only completed half the program, the institution should report 1,800 hours for the first three students and 900 hours for the  second group; or a total of 2,700 hours toward the 12-month total.

NEW HIRES - Persons who were hired for full-time permanent employment for the first time, or after a break in service, between July 1 and September 30 of the survey year. These do not include persons who have returned from sabbatical leave. PRIMARY OCCUPATIONAL ACTIVITY - The principal activity of a staff member as determined by the institution. If an individual participates in two or more activities, the primary activity is normally determined by the amount of time spent in each activity. 


FULL-TIME STAFF (EMPLOYEES) 
As defined by the institution. The type of appointment at the snapshot date determines whether an employee is full time or part time. The employee's term of contract is not considered in making the determination of full or part time. 

Occupation - IPEDS Human Resource occupation categories 

The IPEDS HR survey component uses the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system to assist institutions in classifying employees for IPEDS reporting purposes. The SOC is a system used by Federal statistical agencies to classify workers and jobs into occupational categories for the purpose of collecting, calculating, analyzing, or disseminating data. In 2010, an updated version of the SOC system (http://www.bls.gov/soc/) was released. Consequently, the IPEDS HR survey was revised to incorporate the 2010 SOC information. The new IPEDS occupational categories are effective with 2012-13 Human Resources reporting.

FACULTY 
Persons identified by the institution as such and typically those whose initial assignments are made for the purpose of conducting instruction, research or public service as a principal activity (or activities). They may hold academic rank titles of professor, associate professor, assistant professor, instructor, lecturer or the equivalent of any of those academic ranks. Faculty may also include the chancellor/president, provost, vice provosts, deans, directors or the equivalent, as well as associate deans, assistant deans and executive officers of academic departments (chairpersons, heads or the equivalent) if their principal activity is instruction combined with research and/or public service. The designation as ""faculty"" is separate from the activities to which they may be currently assigned.

Specific expenses include: janitorial and utility services; repairs and ordinary or normal alterations of buildings, furniture, and equipment; care of grounds; maintenance and operation of buildings and other plant facilities; security; earthquake and disaster preparedness; safety; hazardous waste disposal; property, liability, and all other insurance relating to property; space and capital leasing; facility planning and management; and central receiving. This expense does include amounts charged to auxiliary enterprises, hospitals, and independent operations. Also includes information technology expenses related to operation and maintenance of plant activities if the institution separately budgets and expenses information technology resources (otherwise these expenses are included in institutional support).

	FASB institutions are required to allocate O&M costs to other functional categories (e.g., instruction, research, etc.) while GASB institutions can allocate O&M costs OR report it as a separate functional category.  In an effort to align FASB and GASB O&M expenses, from FY 2010 to FY 2015, O&M was reported as both a functional and natural expense category in IPEDS, causing its total to be equal to zero. However, beginning with FY 2016, both FASB and GASB institutions are required to allocate O&M to all the functions and report it as a natural expense category. 

Prior to fiscal year 2017 this variable would always be equal to zero. Like other natural classification categories OM was reported for all  expense functions (survey column 4) . Unlike other natural classification categories OM also appeared as a function (line 11). Institutions would report positive values of salaries and wages, benefits, depreciation, interest and other expenses on the OM (survey line 11).  However total OM line 11 column 1 was always zero and negative values were reported in the intersection of line 11 and column 4 to balance out the total of all expenses of OM distributed to the functional categories.

This expense does include amounts charged to auxiliary enterprises, hospitals, and independent operations. Also includes information technology expenses related to operation and maintenance of plant activities if the institution separately budgets and expenses information technology resources (otherwise these expenses are included in institutional support).

	FASB institutions are required to allocate O&M costs to other functional categories (e.g., instruction, research, etc.) while GASB institutions can allocate O&M costs OR report it as a separate functional category.  In an effort to align FASB and GASB O&M expenses, from FY 2010 to FY 2015, O&M was reported as both a functional and natural expense category in IPEDS, causing its total to be equal to zero. However, beginning with FY 2016, both FASB and GASB institutions are required to allocate O&M to all the functions and report it as a natural expense category. 

Prior to fiscal year 2017 this variable would always be equal to zero. Like other natural classification categories OM was reported for all  expense functions (survey column 4) . Unlike other natural classification categories OM also appeared as a function (line 8). Institutions would report positive values of salaries and wages, benefits, depreciation, interest and other expenses on the OM (survey line 8).  However total OM line 8 column 1 was always zero and negative values were reported in the intersection of line 8 and column 4 to balance out the total of all expenses of OM distributed to the functional categories.

Total library expenditures per FTE is derived by dividing  total library expenditures by the total 12-month FTE enrollment.

Total library expenditures is the sum of  the following expenses:

Salaries and wages (LSALWAG)
Fringe benefits paid out of the library budget ( LFRNGBN) 
One-time purchases of books, serial backfiles, and other materials (LEXMSBB)
Ongoing commitments to subscriptions  (LEXMSCS) 
Other materials/services expenditures (LEXMSOT) 
Total operations and maintenance expenditures (LEXOMTL)

The number of FTE students is calculated based on the credit and/or contact hours reported by the institution on the IPEDS 12-month enrollment (E12) component and the institution's calendar system, as reported on the IC Header component. The following table indicates the level of instructional activity used to convert the credit and/or contact hours reported to an indicator of full-time equivalents (FTE students): 
   - Quarter calendar system
         - Enrollment level (One FTE over 12-month period)
               -Undergraduate 45 credit hours, 900 contact hours
               -Graduate 36 credit hours
   - Semester/trimester/4-1-4 plan/other calendar system
         -Enrollment level (one FTE over 12-month period)
               -Undergraduate 30 credit hours 900 contact hours
               -Graduate 24 credit hours
For institutions with continuous enrollment programs, FTE is determined by dividing the number of contact hours attempted by 900.

Institutions have the choice of using the estimated FTE generated from the above formula or report their own FTE.

The total 12-month FTE is generated by summing the estimated or reported undergraduate FTE and the estimated or reported graduate FTE and reported Doctor's Professional Practice FTE.","Derived - IPEDS, Spring 2020, Academic Libaries component",Academic Libraries: Fiscal year 2019,Expenditures

Endowment assets are gross investments of endowment funds, term endowment funds, and funds functioning as endowment for the institution and any of its foundations and other affiliated organizations. Endowment funds are funds whose principal is nonexpendable (true endowment) and that are intended to be invested to provide earnings for institutional use. Term endowment funds are funds which the donor has stipulated that the principal may be expended after a stated period or on the occurrence of a certain event. Funds functioning as endowment (quasi-endowment funds) are established by the governing board to function like an endowment fund but which may be totally expended at any time at the discretion of the governing board. These funds represent nonmandatory transfers from the current fund rather than a direct addition to the endowment fund, as occurs for the true endowment categories.

Total net assets (F1A18) divided by total assets (F1A06)

Net assets are the excess of assets over liabilities or the residual interest in the institution's assets remaining after liabilities are deducted. The change in net assets results from revenues, gains, expenses, and losses. FASB institutions classify net assets into three categories: permanently restricted, temporarily restricted, and unrestricted. GASB institutions classify net assets into three categories: invested in capital, net of related debt; restricted (with separate displays of restricted-expendable and restricted-nonexpendable net assets); and unrestricted. Although the terms are similar, the composition of the categories of net assets between FASB and GASB institutions can differ significantly.  

Total assets include current and noncurrent assets

Current assets are assets that are reasonably expected to be realized in cash or sold or consumed during the next normal operating cycle (normally one year) of the institution. Liquidity or nearness to cash is not the basis for classifying assets as current or non-current; thus cash or investments intended for liquidation of liabilities due beyond the one-year period would not be current assets.

Noncurrent assets are assets that are not reasonably expected to be realized in cash or sold or consumed during the next normal operating cycle (normally one year) of the institution. Liquidity or nearness to cash is not the basis for determining classification as current or noncurrent. Thus cash investments intended for liquidation of liabilities due beyond the one-year period are noncurrent assets, as would assets segregated for the liquidation of long-term debts (including amounts due within the next operating cycle). Assets designated to be used to acquire, construct, or improve capital assets would be noncurrent.","Derived DFR - IPEDS, Spring 2020, Finance component",Frequently used financial indicators for all institutions: Fiscal year 2019,Equity ratios

Investment return - Income from assets including dividends, interest earnings, royalties, rent, gains (losses) etc. 
Assets - Physical items (tangible) or rights (intangible) that have value and that are owned by the institution. Assets are useful to the institution because they are a source of future services or because they can be used to secure future benefits 
Interest - The price paid (or received) for the use of money over a period of time. Interest income is one component of investment income. Interest paid by the institution is interest expense. 
Gains - Increases in the institution's net assets from peripheral or incidental transactions. This is in contrast to revenues, which occur from the institution's ongoing major or central operations. Whether a transaction generates revenue or a gain depends on the relationship of the transaction to the institution's activities. For example, the sale of computers by a college store might be part of ongoing central activities, while the sale of surplus computers from administrative offices might be considered otherwise. 
Losses - Decreases in net assets from an organization's peripheral or incidental transactions and other events affecting the organization, other than those that result from expenses.

Net assets are the excess of assets over liabilities or the residual interest in the institution's assets remaining after liabilities are deducted. The change in net assets results from revenues, gains, expenses, and losses. FASB institutions classify net assets into three categories: permanently restricted, temporarily restricted, and unrestricted. GASB institutions classify net assets into three categories: invested in capital, net of related debt; restricted (with separate displays of restricted-expendable and restricted-nonexpendable net assets); and unrestricted. Although the terms are similar, the composition of the categories of net assets between FASB and GASB institutions can differ significantly. 

Total assets include  
a) Cash, cash equivalents, and temporary investments;
b) Receivables (net of allowance for uncollectible amounts);

Liabilities are debts and obligations of the institution owed to outsiders or claims or rights, expressed in monetary terms, of an institution’s creditors. Two types of liabilities are often defined, short-term and long term. Short-term liabilities are those that will be satisfied or paid within one year. Long-term liabilities are those which will not be satisfied within a year. Liabilities include: 1) accounts payable; 2) deferred revenues and refundable advances; 3) Post-retirement and post-employment obligations; 4) other accrued liabilities; 5) annuity and life income obligations and other amounts held for the benefits of others; 6) bonds, notes, and capital leases payable and other long-term debt, including current portions; 7) government grants refundable under student loan programs; and 8) other liabilities (those liabilities not falling in one or more of the above seven categories). The exact categories of liabilities that must be used are not specified and the above are examples only. 
Assets  Physical items (tangible) or rights (intangible) that have value and that are owned by the institution. Assets are useful to the institution because they are a source of future services or because they can be used to secure future benefits.  Assets are usually divided into two categories, current and fixed. Current assets are those that can be readily turned into cash. Fixed assets are those which cannot readily be turned into cash without disrupting the operation of the institution. Fixed assets include intangible assets consisting of certain nonmaterial rights and benefits of an institution, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and goodwill. Categories of assets include the following items: 1) cash, cash equivalents, and temporary investments; 2) receivables (net of allowance for uncollectible accounts); 3) inventories, prepaid expenses, and deferred charges; 4) amounts held by trustees for construction and debt services; 5) long-term investments; 6) plant, property, and equipment; and 7) other assets (those assets not falling in one ore more of the above six categories).

Student services (expenses) - A functional expense category that includes expenses for admissions, registrar activities, and activities whose primary purpose is to contribute to students emotional and physical well - being and to their intellectual, cultural, and social development outside the context of the formal instructional program. Examples include student activities, cultural events, student newspapers, intramural athletics, student organizations, supplemental instruction outside the normal administration, and student records. Intercollegiate athletics and student health services may also be included except when operated as self - supporting auxiliary enterprises. Also may include information technology expenses related to student service activities if the institution separately budgets and expenses information technology resources(otherwise these expenses are included in institutional support.) FASB institutions include actual or allocated costs for operation and maintenance of plant, interest, and depreciation. GASB institutions do not include operation and maintenance of plant or interest but may, as an option, distribute depreciation expense.  

Salaries and wages are the amounts paid as compensation for services to all employees--faculty, staff, part time, full time, regular employees, and student employees.

Title IV federal student aid, includes federal grants or federal student loans. 

Average net price is generated by subtracting the average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid from the total cost of attendance.  Total cost of attendance is the sum of published tuition and required fees (lower of in-district or in-state), books and supplies and the weighted average room and board and other expenses.

The weighted average for room and board and other expenses is generated as follows:

  (amount for on-campus room, board and other expenses * # of students living on-campus. 
  +  amount for off-campus (with family) room, board and other expenses * # of students living off-campus with family
  +  amount for off-campus (not with family) room, board and other expenses * # of students living off-campus not with family)

divided by the total # of students.

Students whose living arrangements are unknown are excluded from the calculation.  For some institutions the # of students by living arrangement will be known, but dollar amounts will not be known.  In this case the # of students with no corresponding dollar amount will be excluded from the denominator.

NORMAL TIME TO COMPLETION - The amount of time necessary for a student to complete all requirements for a degree or certificate according to the institution's catalog. This is typically 4 years (8 semesters or trimesters, or 12 quarters, excluding summer terms) for a bachelor's degree in a standard term-based institution; 2 years (4 semesters or trimesters, or 6 quarters, excluding summer terms) for an associate's degree in a standard term-based institution; and the various scheduled times for certificate programs. 
COMPLETERS WITHIN 150% (OF NORMAL TIME) - Students (within a cohort or subcohort) who completed their program within 150% of the normal time to completion. See Normal Time.
BACHELOR'S DEGREE - An award (baccalaureate or equivalent degree, as determined by the Secretary, U.S. Department of Education) that normally requires at least 4 but NOT more than 5 years of full-time equivalent college-level work. This includes ALL bachelor's degrees conferred in a 5-year COOPERATIVE (WORK-STUDY PLAN) PROGRAM. A cooperative plan provides for alternate class attendance and employment in business, industry, or government; thus, it allows students to combine actual work experience with their college studies. Also, includes bachelor's degrees in which the normal 4 years of work are completed in 3 years
TOTAL TRANSFER-OUT STUDENTS (NON-COMPLETERS) - Total number of students from the cohort or subcohort who transferred out at any time within 150% of normal time to completion. A transfer-out student is a student who has not completed or graduated from the program in which he or she was enrolled, but who has subsequently enrolled at another eligible institution in any program for which the reporting institution provided substantial preparation. 
EXCLUSIONS - Students from the cohort or subcohort who left the institution for any of the following reasons: died or were totally and permanently disabled; to serve in the armed forces; to serve with a foreign aid service of the Federal Government, such as the Peace Corps; or to serve on official church missions.","IPEDS, Winter 2019-20, Graduation Rates component","Graduation rate data, 150% of normal time to complete  - cohort year 2013 (4-year) and cohort year 2016 (2-year)  institutions",Graduation rate data  for 2013 and 2016 cohorts (4-year and 2-year institutions)

The SOC is a system used by Federal statistical agencies to classify workers and jobs into occupational categories for the purpose of collecting, calculating, analyzing, or disseminating data. In 2018, an updated version of the SOC system (http://www.bls.gov/soc/) was released. Consequently, the IPEDS HR survey was revised to incorporate the 2018 SOC information.

Multi-year contract - a contract or employment agreement that is in effect for more than one year (e.g., more than 365 days) where subsequent years of the contract may be contingent upon other factors such as the appropriation of funds. The renewal period of a multi-year contract is not on an annual basis (e.g., a 5-year multi-year contract is renewed every 5 years NOT annually). 
Annual contract - An annually-renewable contract or employment agreement that is in effect for a stated annual period within one year of execution, and may be equal to a period of 365 days, or a standard academic year, or the equivalent.

Does institution have a tenure system?

This variable is derived so that users can disaggregate those employees that are nontenured not on tenure track from those employees that are in an institution with no tenure system. Both EAP and Fall Staff components collect these data using 1 data  field which makes it very difficult to produce tables on tenure.  It is assumed that if all employees are reported in the nontenured not on track/no tenure system column/row, then the institution has no tenure system. If the institution reports at least 1 employee as tenured or nontenured, on tenure track then the institution has a tenure system. This variable can be used in the IPEDS DAS to produce tables on tenure status.  See derivation below: 

All employees, Tenured faculty (EAPTOT,EAPRECTP= 1102 ) > 0  
or  All employees, Non-tenured faculty, on tenure track (EAPTOT,EAPRECTP=1103) > 0
